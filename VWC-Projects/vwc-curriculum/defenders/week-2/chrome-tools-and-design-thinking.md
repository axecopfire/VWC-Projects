# Chrome Dev Tools and Design Thinking

## Chrome Developer Tools
Chrome dev tools are a group of web tools built into the chrome browser.
The primary purpose of this is to debug your web app directly from the browser so that you can see fixes in real time or see where a problem is populating from before going back to your code.

## Homework

Find a rad website or web app and while using Chrome Devtools play around with it with each panel. Break things and enjoy yourself.

## Design Thinking

Design Thinking is a problem-solving method using design and user experience as the primary tools. Every website is solving a problem for someone from your portfolio to a machine-learning app.
For the next two weeks your mission will be to use the three words from the randomly selected team mate and create a profile card on codepen using HTML and CSS. You have to think about color scheme, fonts, shapes and images for the background.
