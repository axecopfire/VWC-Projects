        <figcaption class="caption">The Silver Surfer is a humanoid with metallic skin who can travel space with the <br/> aid of his surfboard-like craft. Originally a young astronomer named Norrin Radd on the planet Zenn-La, <br/> he saved his homeworld from the planet devourer,
            Galactus, by serving as his herald. Imbued in return <br/> with a tiny portion of Galactus's Power Cosmic,[1] Radd acquired vast power, a new body and a <br/> surfboard-like craft on which he could travel faster than light. Now known as the
            Silver Surfer, <br/> Radd roamed the cosmos searching for planets for Galactus to consume. When his travels took him to Earth,<br/> he met the Fantastic Four, a team of powerful superheroes who helped him rediscover his humanity and nobility
            <br/> of spirit. Betraying Galactus, the Surfer saved Earth but was exiled there as punishment.<br/>
