    <figcaption class="caption">Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional antihero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
      Created by artist/writer Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, the character first appeared in The New Mutants #98
      (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made his first appearance in
      The New Mutants and later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool,
      whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated
      healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his talkative nature
      and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers for humorous effect and running gags.
