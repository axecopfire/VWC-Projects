## Week 1, Day 1: Installfest

Hello troops, today's focus is making sure you have all the tools that you will need for sessions.
We will also be answering any questions you have about class afterwards.

If you can not make it to class for some reason, please send us a message in the slack channel.

### Things to Download and Install:

First thing you need to download besides _**[Slack](https://www.slack.com/)**_, is _**[Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/)**_ and Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).
During this time we will go over the [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) and the [Chrome React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).
Finally, last thing you will need to download is a good local editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) are all great text editors to choose from.

### Sites to Bookmark for Heavy Usage:
If you did the prework you should have your [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Repl.it](https://repl.it), [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), and [C9.io](https://c9.io) accounts created by now. Please bookmark them so that they are easy to find.


### Mandatory Reading:

During these sessions, especially in the regards of Javascript, these three sites will be your version of the holy trinity, so bookmark them, read them, do the programming in them and along with the sessions and the homework, you will be successful.
They are the [Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [The Front End Developer Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2017/), and [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). These three online resources will fast track you and shorten the lag time from newbie to adept developer. We also want everyone to read the article [What Is Code](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) by Paul Ford and [Advice from an Old Programmer](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/advice.html) by Zed Shaw.
Your first written assignments will be based off of these two writings.
